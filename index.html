            <h2>Who is she?</h2>
            <p>Diam's, from here real name she is MÃ©lanie Georgiades, was a rapper/singer and autocompositor  for many other artists in France. She is born the 25th of july 1980 on Chypre. At 3 y.o she moved to France after separation of her parents with her mother. Missing her dad and the unstable relationship she had with her mother was always the center of many of her songs. We can actually define her as a broken artist.

              Her songs talked mostly about her, the way she went through life. The public could follow her story since her teenager time till she became adult. We can literally said that her public, saw her growing on her songs. 
              Engaged artist/tortured one, the limit was always thin. She was analyzing her wounds, talking openly about her shadows, but also denouncing the fails of the society, claiming freedom in the name of youth.
